    <p>Voyant Tools is an in-browser suite of tools for the study of electronic texts. You upload a text to the Voyant server or use one already indexed and then you have access to coordinated set of analysis and visualization tools. Voyant will show you trends over the text or allow you to compare different texts in a corpus. It will provide textual statistics and word lists that you can export for use in other tools.</p>

    <p>Voyant was designed by humanists for the interpretation of texts. It doesnâ€™t give you answers, it allows you to explore small or large text collections intuitively. As it is free and runs in the browser on our server it is used for introducing students to text analysis. To learn more about the computer-assisted interpretation of texts with Voyant see our book:</p>
