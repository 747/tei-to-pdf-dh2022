                    <p>Researchers in many disciplines allied to the digital humanities are interested in the graphical content of books and such other forms of documents as periodicals, posters and pamphlets. While researchers already have many tools for extracting and processing text from documents, there are fewer options for the computational analysis of their visual elements – despite the fundamental importance of non-textual elements in printed communications. </p>
                    <p>This half-day tutorial is designed to address the needs of such researchers. The tutorial will present a processing pipeline for printed illustrations that are based on the following four open source software applications developed by the VGG based on over a decade of collaboration with different academic disciplines and industrial sectors:</p>

VISE is based on features that are robust to different image transformations like rotation, scaling, translation, and shear. Furthermore, VISE uses features extracted from different regions of an illustration which enables search using a part of an illustration. This is useful for identifying damaged illustrations (e.g. due to torn book pages) or illustrations that have been modified in certain ways.</hi>

This software incorporates an ImageNet trained model, which can be readily retrained using either local images or images retrieved with user-defined keywords (e.g. ship) via online image search engines (e.g. Google, Bing, etc.). VIC software uses this knowledge to classify and find images in a dataset with content that semantically matches the search keyword.

While the focus of the tutorial is on technical methods in computer vision, it will also cover critical and operational issues such as data capture and cleanup; bias in training data; user experience; and good practice in research reproducibility, software citation and accreditation of invisible labour – issues that digital humanists have a strong interest in foregrounding.</p>
