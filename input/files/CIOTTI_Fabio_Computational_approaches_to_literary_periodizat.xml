                <p style="text-align: left; ">Periodization is one of the fundamental topics of literary studies. As Rene Wellek puts it in one of the most notorious and important books of the last century theory of literature: “the concept of period is certainly one of the main instruments of historical knowledge”, meaning, of course, literary-historical knowledge.

                <list rend="numbered">
                    <item>Historical categories are related to cultural and social phenomena and overlap and interact in complex ways, determining

                    <item>Historical categories interact with and are dependent on geospatial ones, resulting in a multiplicity of asynchronous periodizations;</item>
                    <item>The notion of a historical category in literature is strictly associated with the canonical corpus of texts that are considered representative of a period, and the “dialectics between these two poles, period and canon, are complex and manifold” (Meneghelli, 2013: 3).</item>
                </list>
                <p style="text-align: left; ">This last point is particularly relevant: literary periodization is usually the product of a process of generalization and synthesis, within a historical and social horizon, of the small-scale critical and interpretive practices that characterize the study of literary texts. Being bound to idiosyncratic hermeneutical practices and to the “epistemology of close reading”, periodization suffers from all the pitfalls and limitations of that approach. In the last two decades, the landscape of literary and cultural studies has been enriched by a methodological perspective that is based on a quantitative approach. Among the various disciplinary labels that identify this current in studies, the most common is distant reading, introduced by Franco Moretti in his work on World Literature

The diffusion of distant reading approaches has raised a lively debate and has attracted various criticisms, both from “traditional literary scholars” and from self-critical adopters. One important reason underlying these critical positions is the fact that it lacks sound and coherent rationales from the point of view of the theory: distant reading is the first methodology in literary studies that does not come with a theory of literature embedded in it. Consequently, all distant reading studies derive their theoretical frameworks and terms from literary theories that mostly rely on the notion that literary texts can be explained only by the way of interpretation. On what grounds, then, can we construct a theory of literature amenable to distant reading methods? I think that the better theoretical frameworks are the cognitive and bio-evolutionistic approaches to literature and cultural evolution studies. These theoretical approaches require a change in the level of description of the literary domain and justify the move from \"interpretation\" to \"explanation\" as the real aim of the scholarly inquiry.","container-title":"TESTO & SENSO","ISSN":"2036-2293","issue":"23","title":"Distant reading in literary studies: a methodology in quest of theory","author":[{"family":"Ciotti","given":"Fabio"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Ciotti, 2021).

                <p style="text-align: left; ">The main research hypothesis is if adopting computational quantitative methods, it’s possible to identify time-based groupings in a set of texts distributed over a long historical period. Related to this there is the question of whether those eventual groupings are aligned with traditional historical periodization. The corpus consists of 660 Italian novels and short novels written between 1810 and 2000 of different aesthetic "levels", canonization status, genre, dimension, and authors’ gender. Admittedly, this corpus is still far from being adequate and well balanced, mainly due to the uneven chronological distribution, but it is sufficient for an exploratory inquiry.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left; ">I wanted to test if the corpus can be clustered in a chronological sensible way using an algorithmic approach without presuming any prior categorization: this explains the preference for unsupervised methods in this research. In particular, I have adopted two different approaches, based on different assumptions, analytical techniques and features selection:</p>

While the K-Means clustering of the first matrix has very little relation to chronology, the second one provides clear indicators of temporal segmentation (Figure 2). Therefore, we can say that the incidence of the lexicon related to the sphere of thought/consciousness/emotivity is a signal of an evolutional pattern in the Italian novel. Anyway, also in this case the more clearly time-based cluster is that of the text written in the second half of the 20

Using computational analysis to retrieve key words, phrases, and linguistic patterns across thousands of texts in digital libraries, researchers can draw conclusions based on quantifiable evidence regarding how literary trends are employed over time, across periods, within regions, or within demographic groups, as well as how cultural, historical, and societal linkages may bind individual authors, texts, and genres into an aggregate literary culture.\n \nMoving beyond the limitations of literary interpretation based on the \"close-reading\" of individual works, Jockers describes how this new method of studying large collections of digital material can help us to better understand and contextualize the individual works within those collections.","collection-title":"Topics in the Digital Humanities","ISBN":"978-0-252-07907-8","language":"en","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","title":"Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History","URL":"http://books.google.de/books?hl=de&lr=&id=mPOdxQgpOSUC&oi=fnd&pg=PP2&dq=Macroanalysis:+Digital+Methods+and+Literary+History&ots=R8NZyYyjSh&sig=OkLlZGTVZZMmpYgvq8CQgRzlRSw#v=onepage&q=Macroanalysis%3A%20Digital%20Methods%20and%20Literary%20History&f=false","author":[{"family":"Jockers","given":"Matthew L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6]]}},"locator":"6","label":"chapter"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Jockers, 2013: chap. 6), as compared to authorship and even author gender. Instead, there is some evidence that quantitative empirical analysis partially confirms the relevance of cognitive/emotional lexicon in the evolution of literature. In this direction, I think that a fruitful development of the research will require a more effective way to identify the presence of cognitive/emotional attitudes in texts. To this end, we are training a streamlined Italian BERT language model to identify the relevant textual blocks, and the provisional results are promising.
