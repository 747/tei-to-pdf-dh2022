                <head>Introduction</head>
                <p>Invarsson (2021) suggests a digital epistemology that is to be “understood as an attempt to do digital humanities without being committed to digital tools and objects”. While it is an intriguing idea to leave digital tools and methods out of the equation in order to discern the true epistemological core of DH, we believe that it is equally possible to argue that the use of specific tools virtually shapes and influences the epistemology of DH, or as Nietzsche (1882) put it: “Unser Schreibzeug arbeitet mit an unseren Gedanken
                    <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1">
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            Translation: “Our writing tools [in Nietzsche’s case: his new typewriter] shape our thoughts”.
                        </p>
                    </note>”. Today, Nietzsche’s observations on writing tools can be easily extended to all kinds of research tools, allowing us to ask questions about the epistemological implications of tools for the digital humanities (see Dalbello, 2011; Drucker, 2002; Ramsay &amp; Rockwell, 2012). As there are manifold, rather diverse tools that are used in DH, there is a certain tradition for tool directories that systematically list and categorize different tools. One of the most popular directories is TAPoR
                    <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2">
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            TAPoR: https://tapor.ca/home
                        </p>
                    </note>, which has steadily evolved and by now includes more than 1,600 tools. 
                </p>
                <p>The TAPoR list of tools has been used lately to extract and analyze tools mentioned in DH abstracts (Barbot et al. 2019, Fischer &amp; Moranville, 2020b) and tutorials (Fischer &amp; Moranville, 2020a). The motivation of these analyses is primarily to identify relevant and widely used tools in order to make them sustainably available via infrastructures like the

                    <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn3" n="3">

                        </p>
                    </note>. While the previous studies so far have only looked at comparatively small corpora, we suggest to enhance the scope of DH tool studies by using a large corpus of DH journal articles (
                    <hi rend="italic">Computers and the Humanities</hi>, 
                    <hi rend="italic">Digital Humanities Quarterly</hi>, 
                    <hi rend="italic">Literary and Linguistic Computing</hi>/
                    <hi rend="italic">Digital Scholarship in the Humanities</hi>). The corpus comprises 3,737 articles and covers a time span from 1966-2020, which allows for diachronic analyses of tool usage in DH. In addition to using a larger corpus, we also propose an approach to automatically increase the size of the TAPoR tool list.

                <p>For our experiments we followed the approach described by Barbot et al. 2019 and also used the TaPOR directory to derive queries to find tool occurrences in our corpus. All in all, we found 319 different tools being mentioned throughout the corpus
                    <note place="foot" xml:id="ftn4" n="4">

                <p>It is noticeable that among the top 25 DH tools we find many tools for text and data analysis, but also a large proportion of high-level programming languages. This is certainly a bias of the early days of humanities computing. Taking a closer look at the diachronic development reveals the natural rise and fall of programming languages, with the steady rise of 
                    <hi rend="italic">Python</hi> in the DH since the beginning of the 2010s being particularly prominent (see Figure 2)

                </figure>
                <p>To provide some more high-level insights, we also did a cooccurrence analysis of the most frequent 150 tools, i.e. tools that are mentioned together in an article (see Figure 3). Such cooccurrence analyses could yield insights into typical tool combinations and more complex workflows, for instance the use of 
                    <hi rend="italic" xml:space="preserve">Brat </hi>to annotate 
                    <hi rend="italic">Twitter</hi> data and the use of

                </p>
                <p>All in all, Figures 1-3 show some strong potential to analyze tools to find out more about their epistemological implications of DH. However, the predominance of outdated programming languages and the absence of state-of-the-art tools such as 
                    <hi rend="italic">spaCy</hi> or transformer architectures clearly shows large gaps in the TAPoR list.

                    <hi style="font-family:Palatino Linotype" xml:space="preserve">To fill these gaps, we conducted a second experiment in which we used BERT embeddings to expand our list of tools, as proposed by Wevers &amp; Koolen (2020).

                <p>This approach allows us to identify tools that are not listed in the TAPoR directory directly, but that are mentioned in similar article contexts as the TAPoR-listed tools. Obviously, not all the nearest neighbors identified in this way are actual tools, but if we rank the results according to the number of nearest neighborhoods for the top 25 tools, there are indeed many promising results in the higher ranks

                <p>The experiments by Barbot et al. 2019 and Fischer &amp; Moranville, 2020a/b as well as our follow-up experiments with a larger corpus of texts demonstrate that the empirical analysis of tool mentions in DH publications can be used to discern patterns in the diachronic use of different types of tools. This allows us to explore the effects of tools as rapidly evolving epistemological frameworks in the DH. At the same time, it became clear that the static list of tools as provided by TAPoR has obvious gaps, as the tool landscape is evolving swiftly. We therefore plan to include further directories in follow-up studies, including

Our next steps will be to extend our corpus to also include articles from neighboring disciplines, such as computational linguistics, computational social sciences, information science and others. We also plan to expand the nearest neighbor search beyond the limit of the 25 most frequent tools and to filter the results list manually, to identify reasonable tools.
