It introduces a novel method to creating test collections from smaller subsets. This method is based on what we will introduce as distant supervision’ and will allow us to improve computational modelling in the digital humanities by including new methods of supervised learning. Using recurrent neural networks, we generated a training corpus and were able to train a highly accurate model that qualitatively and quantitatively improved a baseline model. To demonstrate our new approach experimentally, we employ a real-life research question based on existing humanities collections. We use neural network based sentiment analysis to decode Holocaust memories and present a methodology to combine supervised and unsupervised sentiment analysis to analyse the oral history interviews of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Finally, we employed three advanced methods of computational semantics. These helped us decipher the decisions by the neural network and understand, for instance, the complex sentiments around family memories in the testimonies.","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqy082","ISSN":"2055-7671","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","page":"17-33","source":"Silverchair","title":"Understanding memories of the Holocaust—A new approach to neural networks in the digital humanities","volume":"35","author":[{"family":"Blanke","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Bryant","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hedges","given":"Mark"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"citation-key":"blanke_understanding_2020"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Blanke et al., 2020), the application of machine learning (ML) within the historical research process maintains a strong human-in-the-loop element that limits the extent of its proliferation. Part of the reason for this is surely the omnipresence of certain kinds of uncertainty in historical research, which the traditions of historiography have developed powerful (albeit analogue) tools to manage. As Myles Lavan recently suggested, the persistence of these longstanding methods may not be ‘a mistaken belief that uncertainty about the past is qualitatively different from that faced by other disciplines,’

It provides a framework that can accommodate the significant epistemic uncertainty involved in estimating historical quantities, especially (but not only) regarding periods for which we have limited data. Conceptualizing uncertainty in terms of probability distributions is a useful discipline because it forces historians to consider the degree of uncertainty as well as to identify a most-likely value. It becomes even more useful when multiple uncertain quantities are combined in a single analysis, a common occurrence in ancient history. Though it may appear a radical departure from current practice, it builds upon a probabilism that is already latent in historical reasoning. Most estimates of quantities in ancient history are implicit expressions of probability distributions, insofar as they represent the value judged to be most likely, given the available evidence. But the traditional point-estimate approach leaves historians’ beliefs about the likelihood of other possible values unclear or unexamined.","container-title":"The Journal of Interdisciplinary History","DOI":"10.1162/jinh_a_01377","ISSN":"0022-1953","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"The Journal of Interdisciplinary History","page":"91-111","source":"Silverchair","title":"Epistemic Uncertainty, Subjective Probability, and Ancient History","volume":"50","author":[{"family":"Lavan","given":"Myles"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,1]]},"citation-key":"lavan_epistemic_2019"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Lavan, 2019) however. Instead, we propose that ML/AI methods challenge one of the most fundamental and foundational elements of historical research, namely provenance, in ways that are not simple to resolve or document. In historical research, provenance typically refers to the record of where an object, collection, or dataset has come from and the places and ‘experiences’ (additions, transformations, deletions, etc.) it has had since its original documentation. The entry of ML methods into DH might be changing the limits and implications of this definition. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left; ">For such methods to be meaningfully applied to historical research, provenance needs to be reconsidered, modelled from multiple perspectives, and documented differently from the current standards in computer science. Specifically, data transformations that are no longer performed by human actors but by autonomous or semi-autonomous computational systems need to be captured to enable provenance management. Conversely, historians’ reliance on provenance requires that we (a) agree upon a shared definition of data provenance and (b) ensure that ML systems designed for use in this specific context maintain legibility. Such a negotiation between research fields will require more than the current research in explainable AI promises to deliver, making the computational provenance not only be reconstructed but also comprehensible in the multidisciplinary space of DH.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left; ">The research project “PROgressive VIsual DEcision-Making in Digital Humanities” (PROVIDEDH, 2017-2021) has contributed to this requirement by proposing a Visual Analytics (VA) approach to representing and managing uncertainty in DH research and demonstrating how a better communication of human or machine-induced uncertainty can enhance the user experience for humanities scholars using ML models. Among other outputs, the project developed an HCI-inspired uncertainty taxonomy (see Figure 1) differentiating between two main types of uncertainty: human-made and technology-made, which correspond to aleatoric (irreducible) and epistemic (reducible) uncertainty as per previous works in the literature

In this paper, we address the issue of uncertainty representation in the context of the humanities from a theoretical perspective, in an attempt to provide the foundations of a framework that allows for the construction of ecological interface designs which are able to expose the computational power of the algorithms at play while, at the same time, respecting the particularities and needs of humanistic research. To this end, we review past uncertainty taxonomies in other domains typically related to the humanities and visualization, such as cartography and GIScience. From this review, we select an uncertainty taxonomy related to the humanities that we link to recent research in visualization for the DH. Finally, we bring a novel analytics method developed by other authors (Progressive Visual Analytics) into question, which we argue can be a good candidate to resolve the aforementioned difficulties in DH practice.","container-title":"Informatics","DOI":"10.3390/informatics6030031","issue":"3","language":"en","note":"tex.ids= theron_sanchez_towards_2019","page":"31","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Towards an Uncertainty-Aware Visualization in the Digital Humanities","volume":"6","author":[{"family":"Therón Sánchez","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Benito-Santos","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Santamaría Vicente","given":"Rodrigo Santamaría"},{"family":"Losada Gómez","given":"Antonio"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9]]},"citation-key":"theron_sanchez_towards_2019"}},{"id":17046,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/4711545/items/JA3FG6E9"],"itemData":{"id":17046,"type":"book","abstract":"The first part of the book defines the concept of uncertainties and the mathematical frameworks that will be used for uncertainty modeling.

For this reason, this type of uncertainty is better represented as a continuous probability distribution. In addition, this representation allows a better understanding of speculative runs of a given algorithm and enhances the what-if analysis process. For example, a researcher could parametrise an algorithm with a fixed set of inputs and launch it several times, obtaining a range of mean values and deviations encoded in a probability distribution function (PDF), which, if correctly displayed, would allow her to get an idea of how the algorithm behaves. Analogously, the algorithm could be parametrised with a variable set of inputs created by the user running the computation or by other researchers. This operation mode would answer the questions of “what happens if I run the algorithm n times using my assumptions?” or “what happens if I run the algorithm n times using another person’s assumptions?” As in the case of running the algorithm with the same parameters many times, the results of multiple runs with different parameters could also be summarised in a continuous PDF, allowing the desired kind of what-if analysis. We argue this kind of insights are highly valuable, specifically in the case of probabilistic algorithms, such as topic models or word embeddings, and whose results –and thus, interpretations– can vary significantly between different runs

In this paper, we explore task-centric topic model comparison, considering how we can both provide detail for a more nuanced understanding of differences and address the wealth of tasks for which topic models are used. We derive comparison tasks from single-model uses of topic models, which predominantly fall into the categories of understanding topics, understanding similarity, and understanding change. Finally, we provide several visualization techniques that facilitate these tasks, including buddy plots, which combine color and position encodings to allow analysts to readily view changes in document similarity.","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","DOI":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467618","ISSN":"1077-2626","issue":"1","note":"tex.ids= alexander_task-driven_2016","page":"320-329","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Task-Driven Comparison of Topic Models","volume":"22","author":[{"family":"Alexander","given":"E."},{"family":"Gleicher","given":"M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"citation-key":"alexander_task-driven_2016"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Alexander and Gleicher, 2016).

Human actors report this category on a 5-point Likert scale, which is thus best modelled as a discrete PDF. The relationships of dependency between the categories in our taxonomy are bidirectional and self-recurring since, for example, input parameters and data — and therefore the results — are derived from a user’s previous interpretations of textual data and related machine- or human-generated annotations. In turn, these interpretations must necessarily be built upon previous insight obtained by the same or other users who apply computational techniques to the data.

Fuelled by critical voices among the DH community, DH scholars are becoming more aware of the intrinsic advantages that incorporating the notion of uncertainty into their workflows may bring. Additionally, the increasing availability of ubiquitous, web-based technologies has given rise to many collaborative tools that aim to support DH scholars in performing remote work alongside distant peers from other parts of the world. In this context, this paper describes two user studies seeking to evaluate a taxonomy of textual uncertainty aimed at enabling remote collaborations on digital humanities (DH) research objects in a digital medium. Our study focuses on the task of free annotation of uncertainty in texts in two different scenarios, seeking to establish the requirements of the underlying data and uncertainty models that would be needed to implement a hypothetical collaborative annotation system (CAS) that uses information visualisation and visual analytics techniques to leverage the cognitive effort implied by these tasks. To identify user needs and other requirements, we held two user-driven design experiences with DH experts and lay users, focusing on the annotation of uncertainty in historical recipes and literary texts. The lessons learned from these experiments are gathered in a series of insights and observations on how these different user groups collaborated to adapt an uncertainty taxonomy to solve the proposed exercises. Furthermore, we extract a series of recommendations and future lines of work that we share with the community in an attempt to establish a common agenda of DH research that focuses on collaboration around the idea of uncertainty.","container-title":"Information","DOI":"10.3390/info12110436","issue":"11","language":"en","note":"number: 11\npublisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","page":"436","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Evaluating a Taxonomy of Textual Uncertainty for Collaborative Visualisation in the Digital Humanities","volume":"12","author":[{"family":"Benito-Santos","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Doran","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Rocha","given":"Aleyda"},{"family":"Wandl-Vogt","given":"Eveline"},{"family":"Edmond","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Therón","given":"Roberto"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"citation-key":"benito-santos_evaluating_2021"}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Benito-Santos et al., 2021), and it can be used by other researchers in a digital research platform (

Although this kind of encoding may still feel foreign to many researchers trained in the traditions of historical methods, it will only be through this kind of convergence between the affordances and constraints of ML on the one said, and the values and tolerances of historical research on the other, that we will be able to see more widespread integration of ML into historical research workflows.
