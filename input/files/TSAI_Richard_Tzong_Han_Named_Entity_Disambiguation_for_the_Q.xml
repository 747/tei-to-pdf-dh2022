To investigate historical figures with digital humanity methods, the first step is to identify the names of people in texts. Not only is the person's name recognized from the text, but the person's name has to be linked to a knowledge base for reference. This is because the same person's name may refer to different people or other entities. This task is called named entity disambiguation (NED). The problem of historical figures with the same name is particularly serious when studying Manchu and Mongolian historical figures in the Qing Dynasty. A typical example is that the main persons (Cherin-Dorji, Yung-Te, Siang-Lin and Gui-Xiang) involved in the disaster report of the Kharkha Four Leagues </hi>

In contrast, Chinese short text entity linking brings a great challenge due to serious colloquialism and insuﬃcient contexts. The whole process of entity linking consists of two subtasks: entity recognition and entity disambiguation. For the entity recognition subtask, we use description text information in a knowledge base to enhance the performance of entity recognition, and propose the BERTEntityNameEmbedding (BERT-ENE) model. Speciﬁcally, the vector embedding of a entity is ﬁrst obtained by mining the description text of the entity in a knowledge base. Then, candidate entities in the short text are obtained by name dictionary matching technique. Finally, the results are ﬁltered by the BERT-ENE model to fulﬁl the task of entity recognition. In addition, we further propose a combination of the BERT-ENE model and the BERT-CRF model, which signiﬁcantly improves the recognition eﬀect compared with traditional methods. For the entity disambiguation subtask, we regard it as a binary classiﬁcaiton problem. Candidate entities are predicted by a BERT-based binary classiﬁcation model, and then predicted probabilities are sorted. The entity with highest probability is selected as the correct entity. Based on the proposed method in this paper, we achieved the ﬁrst place in the CCKS2019 entity linking task for Chinese short text.","language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Entity Linking for Chinese Short Texts Based on BERT and Entity Name Embeddings","author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Jingwei"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Chunguang"},{"family":"Dang","given":"Jinming"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xuyang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fu"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>

Modeling topical coherence is crucial for this task based on the assumption that information from the same semantic context tends to belong to the same topic. This paper presents a novel deep semantic relatedness model (DSRM) based on deep neural networks (DNN) and semantic knowledge graphs (KGs) to measure entity semantic relatedness for topical coherence modeling. The DSRM is directly trained on large-scale KGs and it maps heterogeneous types of knowledge of an entity from KGs to numerical feature vectors in a latent space such that the distance between two semantically-related entities is minimized. Compared with the state-of-the-art relatedness approach proposed by (Milne and Witten, 2008a), the DSRM obtains 19.4% and 24.5% reductions in entity disambiguation errors on two publicly available datasets respectively.","container-title":"arXiv:1504.07678 [cs]","note":"arXiv: 1504.07678","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Leveraging Deep Neural Networks and Knowledge Graphs for Entity Disambiguation","author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Hongzhao"},{"family":"Heck","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Heng"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>

Thus, a crucial research question is how to obtain supervision in a cost-effective way. In this paper, we introduce \"entity triggers,\" an effective proxy of human explanations for facilitating label-efficient learning of NER models. An entity trigger is defined as a group of words in a sentence that helps to explain why humans would recognize an entity in the sentence. We crowd-sourced 14k entity triggers for two well-studied NER datasets. Our proposed model, Trigger Matching Network, jointly learns trigger representations and soft matching module with self-attention such that can generalize to unseen sentences easily for tagging. Our framework is significantly more cost-effective than the traditional neural NER frameworks. Experiments show that using only 20% of the trigger-annotated sentences results in a comparable performance as using 70% of conventional annotated sentences.","container-title":"arXiv:2004.07493 [cs]","note":"arXiv: 2004.07493","source":"arXiv.org","title":"TriggerNER: Learning with Entity Triggers as Explanations for Named Entity Recognition","title-short":"TriggerNER","author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Bill Yuchen"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Dong-Ho"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Moreno","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Shiralkar","given":"Prashant"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Xiang"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Lin et al., 2020) system to process the texts.
