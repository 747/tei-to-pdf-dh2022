For example, digital storytelling is characterized by interactivity, nonlinearity, flexible outcomes, user participation, even co-creation. Such affordances may be disruptive to traditional humanities scholars accustomed to working alone, with physical objects, and following established theoretical guidelines. However, they may be quite appealing to those seeking new opportunities for cross-disciplinary, iterative approaches to practice-based humanities scholarship and pedagogy. This essay defines digital storytelling as a combination of storytelling techniques, digital affordances, and humanities foci, describes several forms of digital storytelling, outlines frameworks and outcomes associated with their use, and promotes digital storytelling as providing new opportunities for humanities scholarship and teaching, especially with regard to critical thinking, communication, digital literacy, and civic engagement.","author":[{"dropping-particle":"","family":"Barber","given":"John F.","non-dropping-particle":"","parse-names":false,"suffix":""}],"container-title":"Cogent Arts and Humanities","id":"ITEM-1","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"publisher":"Cogent","title":"Digital storytelling: New opportunities for humanities scholarship and pedagogy","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},"uris":["http://www.mendeley.com/documents/?uuid=ceccbb16-d133-44d0-a065-41e561a9435e"]}],"mendeley":{"formattedCitation":"(Barber, 2016)","plainTextFormattedCitation":"(Barber, 2016)","previouslyFormattedCitation":"(Barber, 2016)"},"properties":{"noteIndex":0},"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"}?>(Barber, 2016).

Memory is achieved through knowledge organization and representation methods, including ontology design for people, places, time, events, architectures, etc.; resource description framework (RDF) to describe resources in a universal way and linked data to connect the entities. Culture is presented using both historical records from the library and contemporary reflections from the public. The community aspect engages citizens by having them upload photos and personal accounts of their memories and experiences of the road, adding to the underrepresented art forms housed in library collections (magazines, music recordings, photos, maps, and old movies), the places and people that constitute the history of Wukang Road.

            <p>Wukang Road is famous as the home of many celebrities and historic buildings going back to the colonial era, all having their own stories. Here with digital storytelling, sharing methodologies with oral and public history, we capture the voice of the common people so that the history and culture of Shanghai is democratized in the modern postcolonial era. While the buildings themselves are monuments to the formal history, the
